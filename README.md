<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Data preparation with SQL</h2>
	<i>1. Importing data </i> <br>
	The original dataset was reviewed in Excel to understand its structure, identify irrelevant columns, and check for data types.
	<p>
	The data was then imported into **MySQL**, ensuring the correct formats were applied‚Äîespecially for dates (e.g., `%m/%d/%Y`).

	*2. Data cleaning*
	All cleaning steps were performed using SQL. The full script is available in the project files.
	**Steps included:**
	1. **Removing duplicates**
	- No duplicates were found. If needed:
     ```sql
     DELETE FROM sales_data2_copy WHERE row_num > 1;
     ```
	2. **Standardizing data**
	- No spelling issues, extra spaces, symbols, etc. If any, we could proceed as follows:
	- Spaces before words ÔÉ† SET Country = TRIM(Country);
	- Similar words ÔÉ† SET Country = ‚ÄòCanada' WHERE Country LIKE ‚ÄòCanad';
	- Symbols or dots at the end ÔÉ† TRIM(TRAILING '.' FROM Country) WHERE Country LIKE 'Canada%';
	3. **Handling Null or missing values**
	- No nulls were found. If present, they would be handled via imputation or row removal depending on context, such as adding the price of a piece of equipment with the same price of that equipment in that same store, a price with the average value of its prices in other stores, the category of a piece of equipment with the category of a similar piece of equipment, etc.
	4. **Removing rellevant Columns/Rows**
	  - Example:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE sales_data2 DROP COLUMN row_num;
     DELETE FROM sales_data2 WHERE product IS NULL;
     ```

	<i>3. Analyzing data </i> <br>
	Before moving to Power BI, we ran exploratory analysis via SQL. The script calculates key metrics like **Total Revenue** and **Profit**:

```sql
ALTER TABLE sales_data2 ADD COLUMN Total_Revenue DOUBLE;
UPDATE sales_data2 SET Total_Revenue = (Price_Per_Unit * Quantity_Purchased) - Discount_Applied;

ALTER TABLE sales_data2 ADD COLUMN Profit DOUBLE;
UPDATE sales_data2 SET Profit = Total_Revenue - (Cost_Price * Quantity_Purchased);
	
	As seen in the script, The analysis focuses on 4 aspects:
	- Total revenue & profit by country.
	- Top 5 best-selling products.
	- Top 5 representatives.
	- Best-performing store locations from the last stored week.

<h2>Power BI Dashboard Development</h2>
	<i>1. Importing Cleaned Data </i> <br>
	Cleaned data was imported into Power BI as .csv or directly from the MySQL database. 
	<i>2. data Transformation with DAX </i> <br>
	New measures created:
Total Revenue, Total Profit, Total Discounts Given, and Average Order Revenue.

	Additional columns:
Month Name, Month Number, Day Name, Day Number ‚Äî useful for chronological charts and trend lines.
	<i>3. Dashboard Design </i> <br>
	Design principles:
	- Focused on executive-level KPIs.
	- Key metrics displayed using value cards: Total Revenue, Total Profit, Total Orders, etc.

Visuals include:
	- Bar charts (e.g., daily revenue, revenue by category)
	- Line charts (e.g., monthly trends)	
	- Map charts and scatter plots
	- Filters for dynamic analysis (e.g., by country or store)

	<i>4. Insights  Findings </i> <br>
	Some key observations:
	- December shows the highest revenue‚Äîlikely due to holiday shopping.
	- Tuesdays and Fridays have the lowest sales‚Äîcould inform operational decisions like store maintenance or training days.
	- There is a linear relationship between profit and discounts, which could be further explored using Python or advanced analytics tools.
	- Payment methods are evenly distributed.
Further insights can be uncovered using Power BI filters to segment by country, store, or product category.
